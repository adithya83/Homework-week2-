A sample user story:

Instructions:

As a registered customer,I want to view my account balance and recent transactions in real time,so that I can monitor my spending and ensure there are no unauthorized activities.As an Test Engineer  use the instrcions in the prompt ,

Instructions 
Generate Non functional test cases for the above user story
Genrate only 6 Non-functional test cases\n- Generated Test cases should be easly understanble
 Genrated  Test cases should include steps, expected results and acceptance criteria
 Genrate few negative cases and label them as negative cases
   
Context:

 an AI Assistant give me a Non-Functional Test cases for the user story

Example:
Verify  that sensitive account details (e.g., full account number, routing number) are masked in the UI.(Come under security)
-Measure page load time for the dashboard (balance + last 10 transactions) on a 3G/4G network.(Comes under performance testing)

| **TC ID**   | **Category**                  | **Test Scenario / Objective**                                                       | **Test Steps**                                                                                                                                  | **Expected Result**                                                             | **Acceptance Criteria**                                                         |

| **NFTC_01** | **Performance**               | Verify the dashboard (balance + recent transactions) loads within acceptable time.  | 1. Log in with valid credentials.<br>2. Navigate to “Account Summary”.<br>3. Measure page load time.                                            | Page loads within **3 seconds** on 4G connection.                               | 90% of users should experience ≤ 3 sec load time on 4G.                         |
| **NFTC_02** | **Security**                  | Ensure sensitive account details (e.g., account number, routing number) are masked. | 1. Log in as a valid user.<br>2. Observe displayed account details.                                                                             | Only last 4 digits of account number visible; rest masked.                      | No full sensitive data should be exposed on UI or API response.                 |
| **NFTC_03** | **Reliability**               | Verify real-time balance and transaction updates without delay.                     | 1. Perform a transaction (e.g., transfer ₹100).<br>2. Refresh dashboard.<br>3. Check if updated balance and new transaction appear immediately. | Balance and transaction list update within **2 seconds** of the transaction.    | Real-time updates visible without manual page reload.                           |
| **NFTC_04** | **Usability (Negative Case)** | Verify system behavior when internet speed is very slow (2G network).               | 1. Simulate 2G network.<br>2. Load the dashboard page.                                                                                          | System should show a “slow network” message without UI crash.                   | Application should handle slow networks gracefully with proper user feedback.   |
| **NFTC_05** | **Security (Negative Case)**  | Validate session timeout when user is inactive for a long period.                   | 1. Log in successfully.<br>2. Keep session idle for 10 minutes (default timeout).<br>3. Attempt to refresh page.                                | System should log user out and show session timeout message.                    | Inactive sessions must auto-expire per security policy.                         |
| **NFTC_06** | **Compatibility**             | Verify application responsiveness across multiple browsers and devices.             | 1. Open the dashboard on Chrome, Edge, Safari (desktop & mobile).<br>2. Verify UI alignment and performance.                                    | All UI elements should render correctly; performance consistent across devices. | Dashboard should be fully functional and responsive across supported platforms. |

Log in as registered customer. <br>2. Open balance & transactions page. <br>3. Inspect every field. | Only last 4 digits of account/card are shown; full routing number is hidden. | No full sensitive value is readable on screen or in page source. | No |\n| NF-02 | Dashboard loads in 3 s on 4G | Performance | 1. Throttle network to 4G (≈ 20 Mbps/100 ms). <br>2. Log in & request dashboard. <br>3. Measure load time (navigationStart → loadEventEnd). | Load time ≤ 3 s (median of 5 runs). | 95th-percentile ≤ 3 s on 4G. | No |\n| NF-03 | Decrypt traffic with latest TLS version | Security | 1. Capture traffic with Wireshark. <br>2. Verify TLS 1.3 handshake. | No data packets readable; cipher suite is TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 or stronger. | Server refuses TLS < 1.2 and cipher < 128-bit. | No |\n| NF-04 | Handle 5 000 concurrent dashboard views | Performance | 1. Ramp 5 000 virtual users in 5 min. <br>2. Each user logs in & opens dashboard. <br>3. Monitor response time & error rate. | 95th-percentile response ≤ 1.5 s; error rate ≤ 0.1 %. | System stays stable; no memory leak. | No |\n| NF-05 | Dashboard usable on 320 × 568 phone | Usability | 1. Use iPhone SE emulator (320 × 568). <br>2. Rotate to portrait & landscape. <br>3. Navigate without zooming. | All data visible without horizontal scroll; buttons reachable by thumb. | No critical content clipped; WCAG 2.1 reflow OK. | No |\n| NF-06 | Reject expired JWT token (negative) | Security | 1. Log in & grab JWT. <br>2. Wait until token expires (or tamper exp). <br>3. Request balance API. | API returns 401 Unauthorized; customer sees “Session expired, please log in.” | No balance data returned on expired token. | Yes |"

They are the best in business. I started to learn from UFT, Selenium, Affium, whatnot. Everything that belongs to testing, they have it. So, I prefer everyone to join and excel the test. Thanks.",
